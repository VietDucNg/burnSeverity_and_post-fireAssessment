# burnSeverity_and_post-fireAssessment
 
This study assess forest fire severity and vegetation
regeneration in the Thuan Chau district from April 2019 to April 2021, as well as compare different reflectance indices for burnt severity mapping. 

The most widely used fire severity indices, such as the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR), relativized burn ratio (RBR), and relativized dNBR (RdNBR), are calculated and evaluated based on their accuracy regarding active fire sites reported by MODIS and VIIRS. 

Besides, NDVI was used for assessing the post-fire vegetation regrowth, also the relationship between vegetation regeneration to burn severity is taken into consideration.
